            <h1>Senior Citizens and Their Emotional Needs</h1>
            <h2>Definition according to psychological perspective</h2>
            <p>
                Senior citizens are individuals typically aged <strong>60 years and above</strong>, situated in the <strong>late adulthood stage</strong>
                 of human development. At this stage, individuals face a variety of <strong>biological, psychological, and social transitions</strong>
                 that significantly influence their emotional well-being.
            </p>

            <p>
                From a psychological perspective, emotional needs in senior citizens refer to essential
psychological requirements contributing to <strong>mental health, emotional stability, and life
satisfaction.</strong> These needs include feelings of <strong>love, security, connectedness, and a
sense of purpose</strong> (Papalia & Martorell, 2021). These needs become increasingly
crucial due to factors such as <strong>retirement, health decline, loss of loved ones, and
reduced social interactions.</strong>
            </p>


            <p>
                According to <strong>Erik Eriksonâ€™s psychosocial theory,</strong>senior citizens confront the
                developmental challenge of <strong>"Ego Integrity vs. Despair".</strong> Successfully resolving this
                 stage brings about emotional peace, while unresolved life regrets may lead to despair
                and psychological distress (Erikson, 1982).
                </p>
            <p>
             Recognizing and addressing these emotional needs is crucial to promote positive aging, enhance life 
             satisfaction, and prevent mental health issues like <strong>depression</strong>, <strong>anxiety</strong>,
              and <strong>loneliness</strong> (WHO, 2017). These can be addressed through <strong>empathy</strong>, 
              <strong>emotional support</strong>, <strong>family involvement</strong>, <strong>peer interaction</strong>
              , and <strong>mental health access</strong>.
